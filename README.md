## project description
This project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions of S&P 500 index prices, aiding investors, financial analysts, and policymakers in making informed decisions. 

## data collection
The dataset we consider is the S&P index closing prices over the last 10 years.

## model selection
ARIMA, double exponential smoothing, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forests. 

## evaluation metrics
root mean square error (RMSE), Max Absolute Error Percentage (Max AEP), and Mean Absolute Error Percentage (Mean AEP) 

## model evaluation
The best-performing model was Gradient Boost. For optimal parameters, the RMSE of the forecast and the test data is 31.34 (scale ~4400) and the MAEP is ~2.02%.

## future work
 we could take, like further exploration of ensemble methods, perhaps by borrowing tools from applied topology or network science, and the development of a pipeline that executes a large variety of methods to pick the best strategy for any given financial time series.
